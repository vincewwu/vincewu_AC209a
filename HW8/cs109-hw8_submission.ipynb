    "The discovery of the Higgs boson in July 2012 marked a fundamental breakthrough in particle physics. The Higgs boson particle was discovered through experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, by colliding beams of protons at high energy. A key challenge in analyzing the results of these experiments is to differentiate between a collision that produces Higgs bosons and collisions thats produce only background noise. We shall explore the use of ensemble methods for this classification task.\n",

    "You are provided with data from Monte-Carlo simulations of collisions of particles in a particle collider experiment. The training set is available in `Higgs_train.csv` and the test set is in `Higgs_test.csv`. Each row in these files corresponds to a particle colision described by 28 features (columns 1-28), of which the first 21 features are kinematic properties measured by the particle detectors in the accelerator, and the remaining features are derived by physicists from the the first 21 features. The class label is provided in the last column, with a label of 1 indicating that the collision produces Higgs bosons (signal), and a label of 0 indicating that the collision produces other particles (background). \n",

Now let's see what happens if we try to work with Decision Trees and Missing Data at the same time!

Each line represents 13 (mostly chemical) predictors of the response variable wine class, including things like alcohol content, hue , and phenols.  Unfortunately some of the predictor values were lost in measurement. Please load `wine_quality_missing.csv`. \n",
